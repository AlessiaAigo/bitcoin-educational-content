# A journey into RGB

In this program, we will delve deeply into RGB, a revolutionary multi-layer solution for Bitcoin scalability. RGB employs client-side validation to integrate its smart contracts into Bitcoin, allowing for off-chain contracts and scalable use cases of the protocol. From DeFi to NFTs to asset creation, RGB is a promising technology that can enable many new uncensorable use cases.

In this course, we will first focus on the theoretical aspects, then explore the programming side, and finally, we will look at some concrete real-life examples and exercises. The course originates from a live seminar organized by Fulgur'Ventures and taught by three renowned teachers and RGB experts.

Enjoy and good luck with one of the most advanced topics in Bitcoin.

Hey everyone, and welcome to these RGB courses.

In this new program, you will be learning the basics of RGB programming along with some practical exercises. The courses will be in English only for now. This program was originally part of a 2-week advanced dev bootcamp in Tuscany, Viareggio, organized by Fulgur'Ventures. The first week focused on Rust and SDK and can be found in the program [LN 402](https://planb.network/courses/ln402). In this program, we focus on the second week of the bootcamp, which will cover RGB.

Week 1 - [LN 402](https://planb.network/courses/ln402)

A big thanks to the person who've organize this live courses and the 3 teacher who've particiapted: 

- Maxim Orlovsky : Ex Tenebrae sententia sapiens dominabitur astris. Cypher, AI, robotics, transhumanism. Creator of RGB, Prime, Radiant and lnp_bp, mycitadel_io & cyphernet_io
- Hunter trujilo :  Developer, Rust, Bitcoin, Bitcoin, Lightning, RGB
- Federico Tenga : Doing my part to make the world become a cypherpunk dystopia. Currently working on RGB at @bitfinex

Good luck with your studies, and if you need to reach out to our team or the teacher, please use the appropriate channel. This courses will be upadte shortly with a texte section for each chapter, exams and image. stay tuned.
