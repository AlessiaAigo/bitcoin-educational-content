# Why a PlanB Content Repo? 

- Bitcoin is a revolutionizing technology but there's a ton of things to understand and/or to learn good practices, handy software and hardware to fully adopt it
- Your time is precious, so why not using, contributing and sharing a single location that contains virtually all you need and should know about Bitcoin, high-quality and opensource educational resources from beginner to expert; one repo, thousands of contributors.
- Language should not be an entry barrier, any piece of content that should be translated would be translated. For the moment, the PlanB content is present in the following languages:
    - English
